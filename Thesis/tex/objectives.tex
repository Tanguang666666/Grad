\section{Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Characterize the costs and risks associated with switching between architectures
	\item Identify when and where adaptive architectures in the BMDS may be useful
	\item Create a notional test scenario and train a SODA model to act as a surrogate predictor of system performance under different architectures
	\item Identify performance thresholds in which alternative architectures are more advantageous
	\item Demonstrate improved BMDS performance 
\end{enumerate}
