abstract = {While the phrase ?system-of-systems? is commonly seen, there is less agreement on what they are, how they may be distinguished from ?conventional? systems, or how their develop- ment differs from other systems. This paper proposes a definition, a limited taxonomy, and a basic set of architecting principles to assist in their design. As it turns out, the term system- of-systems is infelicitous for the taxonomic grouping. The grouping might be better termed ?collaborative systems.? The paper also discusses the value of recognizing the classification in system design, and some of the problems induced by misclassification. One consequence of the classification is the identification of principal structuring heuristics for system-of-sys- tems. Another is an understanding that, in most cases, the architecture of a system-of-systems is communications. The architecture is nonphysical, it is the set of standards that allow meaningful communication among the components. This is illustrated through existing and proposed systems.},

@article{Dwyer2014,
abstract = {Although joint programs are typically formed to reduce costs, recent studies have suggested that joint programs experience larger cost growth than non-joint programs. To explain this phenomenon, we present a model that attributes joint program cost growth to agencies' actions to maintain or regain their autonomy. We use this model to motivate principles for architecting joint programs and outline a process that can be used to identify opportunities for reforming current joint programs or for establishing new ones. Finally, we apply our approach to analyze joint program options for NOAA's low-earth orbiting weather satellite program and in doing so, identify several risks facing NOAA's current program and strategies for mitigating them.},
