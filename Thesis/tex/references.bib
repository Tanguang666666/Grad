abstract = {While the phrase ?system-of-systems? is commonly seen, there is less agreement on what they are, how they may be distinguished from ?conventional? systems, or how their develop- ment differs from other systems. This paper proposes a definition, a limited taxonomy, and a basic set of architecting principles to assist in their design. As it turns out, the term system- of-systems is infelicitous for the taxonomic grouping. The grouping might be better termed ?collaborative systems.? The paper also discusses the value of recognizing the classification in system design, and some of the problems induced by misclassification. One consequence of the classification is the identification of principal structuring heuristics for system-of-sys- tems. Another is an understanding that, in most cases, the architecture of a system-of-systems is communications. The architecture is nonphysical, it is the set of standards that allow meaningful communication among the components. This is illustrated through existing and proposed systems.},

@article{Agarwal2014,
abstract = {Negotiation and collaboration issues in large organizations, with centralized control, across the globe, are becoming more complex with each passing day. The Acknowledged System of Systems (SoS) is a new approach that addresses some of these issues in a systematic, efficient manner. This paper proposes a hierarchical architectural framework to support Acknowledged SoS architecting and analysis for a Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisition process. A major challenge of the successful planning and evolution of an Acknowledged SoS is the lack of understanding of the impact of presence or absence of a system and its interface with another constituent system on the overall architecture. The agent based model (ABM) structure developed here provides Acknowledged SoS manager that has both ability to address the managerial issues as well as a decision making tool for SoS architecting. This paper offers a complete integration of the techniques used to represent SoS architectures. The work illustrates the modeling approach through a domain setting. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

@article{Haris2011,
abstract = {In this paper, an approach for adaptive reconfiguration of architecture of a complex system using computational intelligence techniques is proposed. This paper establishes that the simulated change in the relative importance of rules reflecting the significance of customer's key performance attributes could be used to affect architectural evolution. The proposed approach was demonstrated on a sample system. It was also extended to a general system. The evolving system architecture gave the system an adaptive feature in the sense that it accepted alternative components based on the simulated changes in the environment. Architecture alternatives were generated through genetic algorithms (GA), while fuzzy logic was used to determine the fittest architectures based on the ambiguous multi-dimensional performance attributes provided by the customer modeled in quality function deployment (QFD). The weights of fuzzy associative memory (FAM) rules were randomly changed to simulate results of environmental effects and demonstrate how the system would self-adapt. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{DeRoo2009,
abstract = {Customers of today's complex embedded systems demand the optimization of multiple system qualities under varying operational conditions. To be able to influence the system qualities, the system must have parameters that can be adapted. Constraints may be defined on the value of these parameters. Optimizing multiple system qualities under the given set of parameters and constraints is called multi-objective optimization (MOO). This is a well-known mathematical problem, for which numerous solutions have been proposed. The application of an MOO solution in an embedded system involves specific design decisions. It is preferable that these design decisions are documented in the architectural description. Therefore, this paper presents an architectural style, which specializes the component-and-connector viewtype, to enable the analysis and design of an architecture from an MOO point of view. A case study from industry is used to demonstrate the usage of this style.},

System and the most important types of system are defined so that differences and similarities are made explicit. Particular attention is given to that type of system of most interest to management scientists: organizations. The relationship between a system and its parts is considered and a proposition is put forward that all systems are either varietyincreasing or variety-decreasing relative to the behavior of its parts.},

@article{Dwyer2014,
abstract = {Although joint programs are typically formed to reduce costs, recent studies have suggested that joint programs experience larger cost growth than non-joint programs. To explain this phenomenon, we present a model that attributes joint program cost growth to agencies' actions to maintain or regain their autonomy. We use this model to motivate principles for architecting joint programs and outline a process that can be used to identify opportunities for reforming current joint programs or for establishing new ones. Finally, we apply our approach to analyze joint program options for NOAA's low-earth orbiting weather satellite program and in doing so, identify several risks facing NOAA's current program and strategies for mitigating them.},
